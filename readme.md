# SignatureStealer

Signature Kid is a header only tool that steals a signature from a file and copy it to whathever file you want.
Beyond Stealing, Signature Kid goes a step further by Windows Internal to trick the system to treat the copied signature as valid.


#Compile Binary
```
g++ main.cpp steal.cpp -o SignatureKid.exe
```
